# Password Generator Starter Code

The purpose of this challenge is to apply our new knowledge and cement our understanding of foundational JavaScript. We are asked to set up the criteria selection for generating a secure password. Through the usage of various JavaScript elements such as functions, conditionals, and variables, we are able to achieve this task.

After setting up my repository workflow, figuring out what to do first was already a challenge. There was a bit of uncertainty about certain aspects of the Acceptance Criteria. Once I figured out how to apply prompts, then came the challenge of translating the prompt inputs into something that would actually generate a password.
