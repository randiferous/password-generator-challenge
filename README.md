# Password Generator Starter Code

The purpose of this challenge is to apply our new knowledge and cement our understanding of foundational JavaScript. We are asked to set up the criteria selection for generating a secure password. Through the usage of various JavaScript elements such as functions, conditionals, and variables, among others we are able to achieve this task.

This challenge was difficult to begin at first. It took awhile for me to grasp the logic behind JavaScript. It was only once I began to understand the link between various parts that my confidence grew and I was able to make progress.

Here is a list of noteworthy observations I made during this challenge:
- Whenever possible, use "console.log".  As a beginner, it is important that you keep track of what is happening.
- Provide relevant names for functions, variables, and arrays. On that note, provide comments whenever you feel necessary. It is important to understand what a certain block of code is referring to both for your own sake and that of others.
- There are many interesting functionalities that you can unlock once you grasp the basics (for instance, being able to combine arrays).
- The order in which you place the code is important both for the computer reading it and for yourself in understanding it.
- In JavaScript, there may be multiple correct answers to a certain problem. It is on you to figure out not only the best one but the one that makes sense to you.

Overall, this challenge was definitely worth the time it took. I learned a lot through trial and error and was forced to conduct my own research throughout the process. Here is the URL link where you can test the password generation: https://randiferous.github.io/password-generator-challenge/
